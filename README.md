# 🎨 GeoPalettes: Color Palettes for Geosciences

A collaborative repository of color palettes designed for visualizing geoscientific variables such as elevation, air temperature, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and more. This project aims to promote accessible, aesthetically pleasing, and scientifically meaningful visualizations, with attention to color blindness safety and contextual relevance.

## 🌍 Purpose

To build an open, well-documented collection of color palettes, each accompanied by metadata including:

- **Variable represented** (e.g., elevation, temperature)
- **Suggested value range**
- **Color format** (i.e. `#HEX`)
- **Color blindness safety** (`blindsafe`)
- **Recommended usage context** (maps, charts, models, etc.)
- **Theme or inspiration** (natural gradients, thermal spectrum, etc.)
- **Authorship and contributions**

## 🤝 Collaboration

This project is a collaborative initiative with [Joshua Stevens](@jscarto). Contributions from all are welcome!
